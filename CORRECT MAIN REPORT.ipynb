    "**Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to evaluate whether students without access to free public transportation would benefit from owning and using a car for commuting to Delft. Specifically, the objectives are to:\n",
    "- Quantify and compare the costs of commuting to Delft by car and by train. \n",
    "- Quantify and compare the travel times of these two modalities, including the influence of peak-hours.\n",
    "- Identify the commuting threshold at which train travel becomes more cost-effective or time-efficient than car ownership.  \n",
    "- Provide insights that help students make an informed decision regarding the choice between car and train for commuting to Delft.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these objectives, the study focuses on the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Research Question**  \n",
    "- How do travel costs and travel times compare between private car use and train travel for commuting from major Dutch cities to Delft during weekday peak hours?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-questions**  \n",
    "1. What are the main cost components of commuting by car and by train, and how do these compare per month?  \n",
    "2. At what commuting distance or threshold does train travel become more cost-effective than car ownership or vice versa?  \n",
    "3. How does travel time differ between car and train, taking into account peak-hour road congestion as well as train schedules, delays, and service disruptions?     \n",
    "4. How do variations in fuel price, road tax, or train ticket price affect the comparative outcomes?   "

    "## 4. Possible DataSets and Data gathering process\n",
    "To start the research, first correct data sources have to be found which can be used to asses our questions. The first step is to find as many sources as possible and see if there even are data sources which support our object. Below a list can be found of data sources related to our subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Usefull datasources\n",
    "- Train disruptions: [Rijden de Treinen Open Data](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/open-data)  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Data collection process\n",
    "The second step is to asses whether these datasets are usefull and if they are able to be extruded for our goals:\n",
    "- ✅ If so, the data set will be integrated in our data folder to use in our analysis . \n",
    "- ❌ If the data is not usefull because the data is not applicable to our problem OR if we're not able to read the data because the data is to difficult to read OR requires high-level understanding of out-of-scope coding OR the data is simply not available in an online data set, THEN we'll manually extrude the data into csv files.\n",

    "To account for a wide spatial spread of origins, major Dutch railway stations were chosen as representative locations. The travel distance and duration data were obtained using the OpenRouteService (ORS) API, an open-source routing platform based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. A CSV file (`Dutch_Central_Stations_Coordinates.csv`) containing the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the central stations of major Dutch cities was used as the input. For each station, the file listed the name, latitude, and longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinates were read from this CSV file and processed by the ORS distance matrix service, which automatically calculates the travel distance and travel time between every pair of locations in the dataset based on the real road network. The station coordinates were loaded into Python using the `pandas` library, after which the ORS API client was initialized with a personal API key obtained from [OpenRouteService](https://www.openrouteservice.org). Using the `distance_matrix()` function with the *driving-car* profile, both travel distances (in kilometers) and travel durations (in seconds, later converted to minutes) were computed between every pair of stations. The resulting matrices were then organized into `pandas` DataFrames and exported to an Excel file (`Matrices_Stations.xlsx`), containing two separate sheets for distances and travel times. This procedure produced a complete pairwise matrix of realistic driving distances and travel durations between all listed Dutch railway stations, derived from the OpenStreetMap road network.\n",
