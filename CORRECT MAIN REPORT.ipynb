    "## 1. Motivation & introduction\n",
    "Transportation choices significantly impact students’ daily lives, particularly those commuting to Delft without access to free public transportation. This study examines whether owning and using a private car is a worthwhile alternative to traveling by train for such students. By comparing both modes of transport in terms of cost, travel time, and convenience (especially during weekday peak hours) the project aims to provide data-driven insights that can help students make informed commuting decisions. Ultimately, this comparative analysis seeks to identify under what conditions car travel becomes more or less advantageous than using the train for regular journeys to Delft.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to evaluate whether students without access to free public transportation would benefit from owning and using a car for commuting to Delft. Specifically, the objectives are to:\n",
    "- Quantify and compare the costs of commuting to Delft by car and by train. \n",
    "- Quantify and compare the travel times of these two modalities, including the influence of peak-hours.\n",
    "- Identify the commuting threshold at which train travel becomes more cost-effective or time-efficient than car ownership.  \n",
    "- Provide insights that help students make an informed decision regarding the choice between car and train for commuting to Delft.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these objectives, the study focuses on the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Research Question**  \n",
    "- How do travel costs and travel times compare between private car use and train travel for commuting from major Dutch cities to Delft during weekday peak hours?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-questions**  \n",
    "1. What are the main cost components of commuting by car and by train, and how do these compare per month?  \n",
    "2. At what commuting distance or threshold does train travel become more cost-effective than car ownership or vice versa?  \n",
    "3. How does travel time differ between car and train, taking into account peak-hour road congestion as well as train schedules, delays, and service disruptions?     \n",
    "4. How do variations in fuel price, road tax, or train ticket price affect the comparative outcomes?   "

    "## 3. Possible DataSets and Data gathering process\n",
    "To start the research, first correct data sources have to be found which can be used to asses the main questions. The first step is to find as many sources as possible and see if there even are data sources which support our object. Below a list can be found of data sources related to our subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Useful datasources\n",
    "- Train disruptions: [Rijden de Treinen Open Data](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/open-data)  \n",
    "- Pump price (daily, from 2006): [CBS](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/cijfers/detail/80416ned)  \n",
    "- NS routes and stations: [NS API Developer Portal](https://apiportal.ns.nl/) \n",
    "- Possible typical cars for students: [marktplaats] (https://wwww.marktplaats.nl) \n",

    "- Insurance costs: [Geld.nl Datamonitor](https://www.geld.nl/autoverzekering/service/datamonitor-autoverzekering)  \n",
    "- Time and Distance data: [Google Maps](maps.google.com) (https://www.openrouteservice.org)\n",
    "- Distances between cities: [CBS] (https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/maatwerk/2019/27/matrix-afstanden-over-de-weg-woonkernen-2017) (https://www.openrouteservice.org) \n",
    "- Train Cost: [NS website](www.ns.nl)\n",
    "- Distances between train stations: [Rijden de Treinen Tariefafstanden](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/open-data/tariefafstanden)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Data collection process\n",
    "The second step is to asses whether these datasets are usefull and if they are able to be extruded for our goals:\n",
    "- ✅ If so, the data set will be integrated in our data folder to use in our analysis . \n",
    "- ❌ If the data is not usefull because:\n",
    "    - The data is not applicable to our problem\n",
    "    - We are not able to read the data because the data is to difficult to read (unknown datatype)\n",
    "    - It requires high-level understanding of out-of-scope coding\n",
    "    - The data is simply not available in an online data set\n",
    "    - -> THEN we'll manually extrude the data into csv files by reading out known websites such as google.maps.com and NS.nl\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection has been split up per modality per variable  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.1 Car information & cost\n",
    "**General car information**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the car it is important to define what **specific car** a student would drive. For this direct fellow befriended students were asked if they have a car, and the ones who had a car answered with smaller models, with two of them a toyota aygo. Thus, for the car information a Toyota Aygo from 2013 was chosen. For this an advert from Marktplaats was taken with the following information:\n",
    "- Maintanence Costs per Month: 59.44; euro/month\n",
    "- Average fuel efficiency: 23.3; km/l\n",
    "- The datasheet for this car has been added in the datalist, but it has been  anonymized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pumpprices**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the car drives on fossil fuel, the pump prices needs to be found. The research focusses on monthly cost, so the monthly average of the pumprices needs to be found. For this the the datasheet from the CBS site for the month september was used:\n",
    "https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/cijfers/detail/80416ned)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Insurance**\n",
    "\n",
    "An important cost factor which differs per city is the insurance cost. The insurance is bassed on the driver and the type of car. Unfortunatelly there are too many insurances to compare and no general datasheet can be found for the insurance per city, as this varies even per day. So the insurance for the mentioned 2013 Toyota Aygo for a studen with 0-damage-free-years has been taken from [www.independer.nl](https://www.independer.nl/autoverzekering/intro.aspx). From this, a list has been created for the insurance cost in every city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Taxes**\n",
    "\n",
    "The major tax to be paid is \"motorrijtuigenbelasting\", vehicle taxes. This differs per province. Also for this there is no central sheet from the goverment as it differs per car weight. So this sheet has been made from the official goverment website calculator. https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/auto-en-vervoer/content/hulpmiddel-motorrijtuigenbelasting-berekenen\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parking permit**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can park freely at the TU Delft, but in most city centres, where the students live, you can not. This differs per city. Once again no central sheet exists for this information as every municipality makes its own rules. The information for this has been gathered from the 12 local government websites providing the parking permit information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.2 Car time & distance\n",
    "To account for a wide spatial spread of origins, major Dutch railway stations were chosen as representative locations. The travel distance and duration data were obtained using the OpenRouteService (ORS) API, an open-source routing platform based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. A CSV file (`Dutch_Central_Stations_Coordinates.csv`) containing the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the central stations of major Dutch cities was used as the input. For each station, the file listed the name, latitude, and longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinates were read from this CSV file and processed by the ORS distance matrix service, which automatically calculates the travel distance and travel time between every pair of locations in the dataset based on the real road network. The station coordinates were loaded into Python using the `pandas` library, after which the ORS API client was initialized with a personal API key obtained from [OpenRouteService](https://www.openrouteservice.org). Using the `distance_matrix()` function with the *driving-car* profile, both travel distances (in kilometers) and travel durations (in seconds, later converted to minutes) were computed between every pair of stations. The resulting matrices were then organized into `pandas` DataFrames and exported to an Excel file (`Matrices_Stations.xlsx`), containing two separate sheets for distances and travel times. This procedure produced a complete pairwise matrix of realistic driving distances and travel durations between all listed Dutch railway stations, derived from the OpenStreetMap road network.\n",
