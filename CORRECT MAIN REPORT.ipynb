    "## 1. Motivation & introduction\n",
    "Transportation choices significantly impact students’ daily lives, particularly those commuting to Delft without access to free public transportation. This study examines whether owning and using a private car is a worthwhile alternative to traveling by train for such students. By comparing both modes of transport in terms of cost, travel time, and convenience (especially during weekday peak hours) the project aims to provide data-driven insights that can help students make informed commuting decisions. Ultimately, this comparative analysis seeks to identify under what conditions car travel becomes more or less advantageous than using the train for regular journeys to Delft.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to evaluate whether students without access to free public transportation would benefit from owning and using a car for commuting to Delft. Specifically, the objectives are to:\n",
    "- Quantify and compare the costs of commuting to Delft by car and by train. \n",
    "- Quantify and compare the travel times of these two modalities, including the influence of peak-hours.\n",
    "- Identify the commuting threshold at which train travel becomes more cost-effective or time-efficient than car ownership.  \n",
    "- Provide insights that help students make an informed decision regarding the choice between car and train for commuting to Delft.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these objectives, the study focuses on the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Research Question**  \n",
    "- How do travel costs and travel times compare between private car use and train travel for commuting from major Dutch cities to Delft during weekday peak hours?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-questions**  \n",
    "1. What are the main cost components of commuting by car and by train, and how do these compare per month?  \n",
    "2. At what commuting distance or threshold does train travel become more cost-effective than car ownership or vice versa?  \n",
    "3. **How does travel time differ between car and train, taking into account peak-hour road congestion as well as train schedules, delays, and service disruptions?**     \n",
    "4. How do variations in fuel price, road tax, or train ticket price affect the comparative outcomes?   "

    "## 3. Possible DataSets and Data gathering process\n",
    "To begin the research, we first need to identify appropriate data sources that can be used to address the main research questions. The initial step is to collect as many relevant datasets as possible and determine whether they support our objectives. Below is a list of datasets related to the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Useful datasources\n",
    "- Train disruptions: [Rijden de Treinen Open Data](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/open-data)  \n",
    "- Pump price (daily, from 2006): [CBS](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/cijfers/detail/80416ned)  \n",
    "- NS routes and stations: [NS API Developer Portal](https://apiportal.ns.nl/) \n",
    "- Possible typical cars for students: [marktplaats] (https://wwww.marktplaats.nl) \n",
    "- Government Road tax: [Motorrijtuigenbelasting | Belastingdienst](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/prive/auto_en_vervoer/belastingen_op_auto_en_motor/motorrijtuigenbelasting/)\n",
    "- Insurance costs: [Geld.nl Datamonitor](https://www.geld.nl/autoverzekering/service/datamonitor-autoverzekering)  \n",
    "- Time and Distance data: [Google Maps](maps.google.com) (https://www.openrouteservice.org)\n",
    "- Distances between cities: [CBS] (https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/maatwerk/2019/27/matrix-afstanden-over-de-weg-woonkernen-2017) (https://www.openrouteservice.org) \n",
    "- Train Cost: [NS website](www.ns.nl)\n",
    "- Distances between train stations: [Rijden de Treinen Tariefafstanden](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/open-data/tariefafstanden)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Data collection process\n",
    "The second step is to assess whether these datasets are useful and if they are able to be extracted for our goals:\n",
    "- ✅ If so, the data set will be integrated in our data folder to use in our analysis. \n",
    "- ❌ If the data is not useful because:\n",
    "    - The data is not applicable to our problem\n",
    "    - We are not able to read the data because the data is to difficult to read\n",
    "    - It requires high-level understanding of out-of-scope coding\n",
    "    - The data is simply not available in an online data set\n",
    "    - -> THEN we will manually extract the data into csv files by reading out known websites such as google.maps.com and NS.nl\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection has been split up per modality per variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.1 Car information & cost\n",
    "**General car information**\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent a typical student car, we surveyed fellow students and found that smaller models are common; two respondents specifically mentioned a Toyota Aygo. Therefore, we selected a 2013 Toyota Aygo as the representative vehicle and collected data from a Marktplaats advert. The advert provided the following details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintenance cost per month: €59.44\n",
    "- Average fuel efficiency: 23.3 km/l\n",
    "- The car datasheet has been added to the data list and anonymized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fuel prices**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the car uses fossil fuel, we obtained fuel (pump) prices and calculated the monthly average fuel price to estimate monthly fuel expenses. For this the datasheet from the CBS website for the month september was used:\n",
    "https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/cijfers/detail/80416ned)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Insurance**\n",
    "\n",
    "An important cost factor that varies between cities is **car insurance**. The premium depends on both the driver and the type of vehicle. Unfortunately, there are too many insurance providers to make a consistent comparison, and no unified dataset exists since rates fluctuate daily. Therefore, the insurance cost for a **2013 Toyota Aygo**, driven by a **student with 0 damage-free years**, was obtained from [www.independer.nl](https://www.independer.nl/autoverzekering/intro.aspx). Based on this source, a list of estimated insurance costs per city has been compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Taxes**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main tax that applies is the **motorrijtuigenbelasting** (vehicle tax), which differs per province and is based on the car’s weight. There is no central government dataset for this, so values were calculated using the official tax calculator provided by the Dutch Tax Authority:  \n",
    "[https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/auto-en-vervoer/content/hulpmiddel-motorrijtuigenbelasting-berekenen](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/auto-en-vervoer/content/hulpmiddel-motorrijtuigenbelasting-berekenen)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parking permit**\n",
    "\n",
    "At **TU Delft**, parking is free, but in most city centers where students live, it is not. Parking rules and permit fees vary by municipality, and there is no centralized dataset for this information. Data for parking permits were collected from the **12 respective municipal websites** that publish local parking policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.2 Car Time & Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the wide geographical spread of starting locations, major Dutch railway stations were selected as reference points. Travel distance and duration data were obtained using the **OpenRouteService (ORS) API**, an open-source routing tool based on **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** data. The input data came from a CSV file (`Dutch_Central_Stations_Coordinates.csv`) containing the names and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of central stations in major Dutch cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinates from this file were read into Python using the `pandas` library and processed through the ORS **distance matrix** service. This service automatically computes travel distances and times between all pairs of locations in the dataset, based on real road network data. An ORS API client was initialized using a personal API key obtained from [OpenRouteService](https://www.openrouteservice.org). Using the `distance_matrix()` function with the *driving-car* profile, both **travel distances** (in kilometers) and **travel times** (in seconds, later converted to minutes) were calculated for every station pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting matrices were stored in `pandas` DataFrames and exported to an Excel file (`Matrices_Stations.xlsx`), which contains two separate sheets — one for distances and one for travel times. This method produced a complete pairwise matrix of realistic driving distances and durations between all major Dutch railway stations, derived from the OpenStreetMap road network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4.3 Train time & costs\n",
    "'Tariefeenheden' are distance units used in Dutch public transport to calculate travel fares and the travel time. They roughly correspond to kilometers but are based on fixed routes between stations. The total number of tariefeenheden between the departure and arrival stations determines the ticket price, which is calculated using a base fare plus a rate per tariefeenheid. The data sheet is available, but because the exact calculation method is not, we used the NS website to determine the train costs and travel times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we added 10 minutes to the travel time to account for the journey from Delft station to the campus.\n",
