    "- Quantify and compare the costs of commuting to Delft by car and by train. \n",
    "- Quantify and compare the travel times of these two modalities, including the influence of peak-hours.\n",
    "- Identify the commuting threshold at which train travel becomes more cost-effective or time-efficient than car ownership.  \n",
