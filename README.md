## 1. Overview
This project investigates whether owning and using a private car is a worthwhile alternative to train travel for students commuting to Delft without access to free public transport. By comparing both modes of transport in terms of monthly cost and total travel time, this study aims to provide data-driven insights that support informed commuting decisions.

 
## 2. Repository Content:
- base data: containing datasets we collected.
- processed_data: containing datasets we filtered or created.
- code: containing all the python scripts of calculations, the matrix generator and visualization of data.
- figures: containing all the car/train/comparison graphs.
- main report: the main report notebook file and html file.
- README: file with instructions.


## 3. Data Sources
All datasets are publicly available or manually extracted from reliable online sources. They are stored in the `/base data/` directory to ensure reproducibility.

| Category | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Car distances & travel times | [OpenRouteService (ORS) API – OpenStreetMap](https://www.openrouteservice.org) |
| Train distances, travel times & fares | [NS website](https://www.ns.nl/) |
| Fuel prices | [CBS – Pump price daily](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/maatwerk/2006) |
| Car information | [Marktplaats](https://www.marktplaats.nl) |
| Insurance | [Independer](https://www.independer.nl/autoverzekering/intro.aspx) |
| Road taxes | [Belastingdienst – Motorrijtuigenbelasting](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/auto-en-motor) |
| Parking permits | Municipal websites |
| Train disruptions / delays | [Rijden de Treinen Open Data](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/) |

**Directory structure `/base data/`:**
This contains the following datasets:
- Car_Information.csv
- Dutch_Central_Stations_Coordinates.csv
- Pompprijzen_motorbrandstoffen__brandstofsoort__per_dag_06102025_122232.csv
- RoadTaxes_InsuranceCity_ParkingPermitCity.csv
- TrainDistancesDelft_NSPrices_NSTravelTime.csv

**Output directories (initially empty):**
`/processed_data/`: processed CSV files generated by notebooks
`/figures/`: visualizations (subfolders for Car, Train, Comparison)

## 4. Reproduction Guide
### 4.1 Requirements
To reproduce the analysis, the following are required:

- Python 3.12
- Installed Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `adjustText`
  - `openrouteservice`
- Standard Python libraries used in the notebooks: `os`, `math`, `pathlib`, `re` (no extra installation needed)

### 4.2 General Setup 
To regenerate the car distance and travel time matrices:

1. Create an account at [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org)  
2. Generate a free API key  
3. Open the notebook `#1_Matrix_generator.ipynb`  
4. Replace the placeholder API key with your own key  
5. Run the notebook to produce updated `CarDistance_matrix.csv` and `CarTime_matrix.csv` files. Please note that this could give slightly different outcomes. 

Key parameters:

| Parameter       | Value / Description |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Traveler        | 21-year-old student (no free OV) |
| Frequency       | 4 days/week → 18 round trips/month |
| Start point     | Central station of each city |
| End point       | TU Delft campus |
| Car             | Toyota Aygo 2013 (23.3 km/l, €59.44/month maintenance) |
| Congestion      | +35% added travel time (TomTom Traffic Index 2024) |
| Train           | +10 min bike transfer to campus (Swapfiets €17.90/month) |
| Train delays    | 8.5% of trains delayed >5 min, not included quantitatively |


### 4.3 Execution Order of Notebooks
To reproduce all figures, tables, and analyses in the report one can run the notebooks in ascending order:
1. Run `#1_Matrix_generator.ipynb`
   - Generates the car distance and travel time matrices in `/processed_data/`  
   - These files are used as input for subsequent notebooks analyzing car travel
2. Run other notebooks: 
They read from `/base data/` (raw datasets like train fares, fuel prices, road taxes) and `/processed_data/` (matrices or previously processed outputs)
   - `#2_Filter_Cardata.ipynb`
   - `#3_Car_Calculations.ipynb`
   - `#4_Train_calculations_basics.ipynb`
   - `#5_Comparing car train calculations and graphs.ipynb`

The outputs are saved to:
- `/processed_data/` (for tabular results)  
- `/figures/` (for visualizations), which are organized in subfolders for Car, Train, and Comparison     
     
Following this procedure ensures full reproducibility: all tables, figures, and analyses can be regenerated using the provided notebooks and data files.
